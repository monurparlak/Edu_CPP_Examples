Question #24

Question:
Write a C++ Program to Find the Second Smallest Element in an Array.

My Answer:
âœ… Output: Second smallest element is 10

Reason:
- Initialize first and second as INT_MAX.
- Traverse array: update first and second accordingly.
- After loop, if second still INT_MAX, no second smallest exists.

If Wrong:
Ensure duplicates of smallest are not counted as second smallest.

#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void print2Smallest(int arr[], int n) {
    int first, second;
    if (n < 2) { cout << " Invalid Input "; return; }
    first = second = INT_MAX;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] < first) { second = first; first = arr[i]; }
        else if (arr[i] < second && arr[i] != first) second = arr[i];
    }
    if (second == INT_MAX) cout << "There is no second smallest element\n";
    else cout << "Second smallest element is " << second << endl;
}

int main() {
    int arr[] = {21, 3, 15, 41, 34, 10};
    int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    print2Smallest(arr, n);
    return 0;
}
